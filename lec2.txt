2. Explain the differences between public key and symmetric encryption schemes. Also, explicate
the respective advantages and disadvantages.
	- Symmetric encryption schemes: key is identical for sender and receiver
	-- Advantages:
		+ faster
		+ Because the key is not transmitted with the data, so if the connection is intercepted, the data is safe
		+ Only the system which possesses the secret key can decrypt a message
	--Disadvantages:
		+ The secret key must be exchange before the message, and if the attacker can intercept the connection, then any message using that key to encrypt can be decrypted
		+ Cannot provide digital signatures that cannot be repudiated
	
	- Public key encryption schemes: different pair of keys for every direction of communication
	-- Advantage:
		+ There is no need to exchange the private key (which help the recipient to read the encrypted message) so if the connection is intercepted, the message is still safe
		+ Can provide digital signatures that cannot be repudiated
	-- Disadvantage:
		+ Slower
		
3. Define the term “hybrid encryption scheme” and outline the sequence thereof.
	- Hybrid encryption scheme is achieved through the mix of symmetric and public key scheme.
	- A wants to send the message to B, the symmetric key is decrypted using B's public 
	  key encryption scheme, then B use its private key to decrypt the symmetric key, 
	  after that, B use the symmetric key to encrypt the message sent by A
	  
4. Explain the term “mode of operation” and outline encryption and decryption for at 
least two different modes.	 
	- Mode of operation is the term used in block cipher which is a method of encrypting 
	  data in blocks of same size to produce ciphertext using a cryptographic key and 
	  algorithm. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher's 
	  single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.
	- Used in CBC, CFM
	
5. Explain what conditions must be met for conducting a brute force attack.
	- Has the plaintext
	- Has something to check the result after brute force, if nothing can 
	  be used for checking the result then the real plaintext can not be known.
	- The length of the key is smaller than the length of the plaintext.

7. Explain how One Time Pads operate and explain why a messace encrypted by this method
cannot be recovered without knowing the used encryption key.
	- The one time pad is randomly generated sequence of bits that has the same 
	  length with the plaintext and then every bit of the OTP is XOR-ed with every bit 
	  of the plaintext
	- Without knowing the used encryption key: All the letters in the key are 
	  uniformly distributed -> no specific pattern -> cannot do the statistic
	  analysis -> impossible to get the correct key
	  
8. Explain how Electonic Code Book (ECB) operates and explain advantages and disadvantages
of this method. Also, explain under which circumstances ECB can be used and when not.
	- In Electronic Code Block, parts of a plaintext are grouped into plaintext blocks 
	of same size. Each of these blocks is encrypted with a key using a encryption 
	method, these blocks then form a ciphertext for given plaintext. 
	Similarly, the ciphertext can be decrypted by being grouped into multiple 
	ciphertext blocks of same size initially. Each of these blocks is decrypted with 
	the key used for encryption and the decryption method equivalent to the 
	encryption method. These blocks then form the plaintext at first.

	- This method should be used when we focus more on performance because of its 
	simplicity, however, it is not secure since it uses same encryption key for 
	every block encryption.

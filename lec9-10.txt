LECTURE 9 FIREWALL

3. Explain what Network Address Translation is and how it works.
	- is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying 
	network address information in the IP header of packets while they are 
	in transit across a traffic routing device
	
	- Since private IP addresses cannot be routed in public networks
	- When a packet come to C from A or B, the IP address of A or B is replaced 
	by the public IP of C (N)
	- Packet is then transfer to D or E, what they would see is the address N, 
	and reply to N
	- When the packet arrive at C as N, the packet is somehow determine whether 
	the traffic is meant to be for A or for B and how to then replace the public 
	address by A's or B's private address
	- It is not enough to only translate IP addresses: there must also be 
	a translation of port number

LECTURE 10 VPN

1. 
**VPN**
	- A virtual private network allows to run a secure seemingly direct point to point 
	connection between two stations, similar to a direct line between 2 stations. 
	By using (potentially) an unsecured network such as the internet. Can be realized 
	in software as well as hardwell. VPN is like a lease private line between 2 stations, 
	but actually a unsecured connection on the internet which emulates this.
	- VPN does not have high availability, but there are means of ensuring the 
	confidentiality and integrity of data. Because of this, private lines
	are still needed to ensure availability.
	
**RAS**	
	- VPN can be done by means of tunnelling and encryption.
	- A remote access service (RAS) is any combination of hardware and software to 
	enable the remote access tools or information that typically reside on a 
	network of IT devices.

1. Define IT security
	- Protection against unauthorized access and unauthorized modification and 
	  availability of information system services for legitimate users, 
	- including measures to thwart, discover and log threats. 
	- Protection against unauthorized access must be ensured during storage, 
	  processing or in transit

2. Aims of IT Security
	- Confidentiality: protection against unauthorized access
	- Integrity: protection against unauthorized modification
	- Availability: resources and services are available for legitimate users
	- Authentication: unambiguous identification of sender of information or a communication peer
	- Nonrepudiation: Ability to prove that a message was sent and by whom to a third party not involved
	  in communication
	- Authorization: access to resources is limited for a certain group of (authorized) users

3. What are passive and active attacks and why is the distinction between them helpful in
practice?
	- Passive attacks: attacker does not actively participate, hard to discover
	- Active attacks: attacker actively participate in manipulating system or data, attacker often leave traces, prevention possible
	- Distinction is helpful in determining the method to defend against the attack

5. Explain the IT-Security process and its phases as outlined in the lecture.
	- Plan, do, check, act
	
6. What is the difference between nonrepudiation and authenticity?
	- Nonrepudiation: ability to prove the message was sent and by whom to third party
	- Authentication: unambiguous identification of sender of information or a communication peer

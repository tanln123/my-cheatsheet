1. What are the main tasks of an Operating System and how do they relate to security?
	- Hide complicated details from users and applications which otherwise had to be dealt with
	- Provide Virtual Machine which is much easier to use 
	- Allocate resources to different users, processes.
	
2. Explain how the access control mechanisms implemented by an Operating System can be
circumvented by an attacker and in which cases it can be enforced.
	- use administrator privilege to access other individual's information in the organization

3. Explain Linux’s access control mechanism in detail.
	- Each file has permissions for 3 different types of users
		- owner
		- in the same group
		- others

4. The ls-l command returns the following output:
		drwxr-xr-x 2 max staff 4096 Mar 27 12:15 test
   Explain each of the fields.
	+ d- : this is a directory
	+ rwxr-xr-x : the owner has the read write execute permissions
				  the user in the group which the file belongs to has read and execute permissions
				  the other users has read and execute permissions
	+ 2 : number of hard links point to the directory
	+ max : username
	+ staff : group name
	+ 4096 : size of directory (bytes)
	+ Mar 27 12:15 : Date and time
	+ test: file name
	
5. Study the man pages for the commands
	- chmod: change permissions of the file/directory for users 
	- chown: change owner of the file 
	- chgrp: change group of the file 
	
7. 
	1. Which permissions are sufficient to execute a file containing a binary? Which permissions
are sufficient to execute a shell script?
	-> x

	2. Which permissions are needed to copy a file?
	-> source: r, destination: w x
	
	3. Which permissions are necessary to move a file?
	-> source: w, destination: w x 
	
8. What happens is you try the command ls -l as a user
	1. on a directory without having read-permissions?
	-> permission denied
	
	2. on a directory without having write-permissions?
	-> can read files and their details normally
	
	3. on a directory without having execute-permissions?
	-> can only read file name, not their details
	
	4. Which permissions are sufficient necessary to change into an directory?
	-> x 
	
9. 
	- setfacl: set ACL of files and directory (ex: Gán quyền đọc , ghi, thi hành 
	  cho user bao và group friend: setfacl -m user:bao:rwx,group:friends:rwx mydir )
	  
	- getfacl: see information of the ACL of the file

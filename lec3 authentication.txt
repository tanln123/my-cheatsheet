1. Define the terms “Authenticity” and “Authentication” and explain possible factors for 
authentication. Also, briefly describe what Two-Factor-Authentication is.
	- Unambiguous identification of sender of information of a communication peer.
	- What you are (biometry), what you know (password), what you have (token)
	- 2-factor-authentication: provide multiple proof of identification to get the permission to access

2. Name and explain on which points the security of password-based authentication schemes
depends.
	- The size of password domain, choice of password and password policies
	- Security of strong password
	- Security when entering/transmitting password
	
3. Discuss how secure passwords should be chosen.
	- Long password, capital letters, special characters, numbers, dont use natural language

5. Describe the sequence in a password-based challenge-response authentication and compare
its security with sending the password directly either encrypted or unencrypted.
	- Compare: Challenge-response authentication can defend against session replay 
	attacks, in which an attacker listens to previous messages and resends them 
	later to get the same credentials as the original message. Challenge-response 
	systems defend against replay attacks, because each challenge and response is 
	unique. An attacker monitoring credentials exchanges and then attempting to 
	reuse credentials will not succeed in gaining access.

6. Describe the terms “Token”, “Smart Card” and “Biometry” and explain their use for authentication.
	- Token: a device that show digits that are randomly changed every period of time,
	  can be calculated on the token with some cryptographic embedded in the token 
	  which is not easy to extracted
	- Smart card: card that is auth by prove themselves to the card reader that they are really presented by means of cryptography
	- Biometry: physical properties of a person. To prove that you are really you.  
	
8. Describe what a digital signature is and how it operates. Also describe how hash 
functions are used in digital signatures.
	- A process that guarantees that the contents of a message haven't been altered 
	in transit. Sender signs message with private key. Public key is used for 
	validation.
	- Hash function: transforming data of any size into a fixed size. Hash function 
	will generate unique digital fingerprint. Alice writes a message to Bob, A will 
	hash the message, and then combines the hash value with her private key to 
	generate a digital signature.
	
9. Explain in detail format, composition and use of certificates. Also describe “Certificate Authorities”,
“Root-CA” and “Certificate Revocation”.

	- Format: Bundle of Information of the owner of public key, along with public 
	key, signature of certificate authority (also info about CA).

	- Certificate authority: take the certificate request which consist of info of 
	the entity (user, web server, ...) along with it's public key, and then it check 
	that this public key is truly belong to that entity. Then CA will sign this 
	certificate with it's private key (compute the hash, then encrypt the hash with 
	private key)

	- Certificate: say B, might not know A but B know its CA and B already had the 
	public key of that CA, so B can check that whether the signature is ok or not. 
	So if B trust this CA, then B can know the public key of A.

	- Root-CA: CA sign its own certificate

	- Certificate revocation: certificate that is no longer valid because that have 
	been withdrawn
	
10. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using cerfiticates and CAs.
	- Advantages: public, so anyone can check the validity of an entity.
	- Disadvantages:
		+ Trustworthy only given if the root CA and other CA involved in the process 
		are trustworthy
		+ CA is compromised and still issuing certificate which might not belong to 
		valid institution
		+ Revocation is problematic because sometime this is not checked.
